## Overview
The app is a Flask based web application that recommends the user movies that are similar to the movie provided by the user. This recommendation is conducted via content based filtering methodology. The application not only caters Hollywood movies, but also take into account the Bollywood movies. 

The application is deployed on AWS and Heroku Platform. Due to storage constraints, only Hollywood movies model is deployed in AWS whereas in Heroku, both Hollywood and Bollywood movies are used.

## Motivation
Today in the era of science and technology, recommendation system plays a vital role in engaging the user to an application. These recommendation engines are so strong in their predictions that they can dynamically alter the state of what the user sees on their page based on the userâ€™s interaction with the app. Hence, it is imperative that recommender system provide the result with greater precision to ensure the maximization of user screen time on the application.
